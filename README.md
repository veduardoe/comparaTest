# ComparaOnline Proposal Refactoring Solution

Hi, in this repository, you will find a simple refactoring proposal solution for Software Engineer CO Test.

### What do you need to run the application?

1. Clone this repository
2. Be sure that you have installed Nodejs + NPM
3. Open terminal from the Root project and run "npm install" to install "Mocha Chai".
4. To run application, just run the following command "npm run after-30-days" and the console will print the "Products After 30 Days" according the following configuration:

```js

[
    new Product('Medium Coverage', 10, 20),
    new Product('Full Coverage', 2, 0),
    new Product('Low Coverage', 5, 7),
    new Product('Mega Coverage', 0, 80),
    new Product('Mega Coverage', -1, 80),
    new Product('Special Full Coverage', 15, 20),
    new Product('Special Full Coverage', 10, 49),
    new Product('Special Full Coverage', 5, 49),
    new Product('Super Sale', 3, 6),
]
```

The result must be the same that file products_after_30_days.txt. 
The values can be changed to be validated.

5. To run Unit Testing, just run the following command "npm run test" to validate:

- Each Product Coverage Condition is Correct.
- Data responses
- Entitiy (Product)
